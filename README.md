* A BLOCKCHAIN-BASED E-VAULT
* Introduction:
For individuals, accurate and full educational records are a valuable asset. Educational documents have been digitised in recent years. There are still, however, two major problems that have not been overcome. One is to achieve reliable and privacy-preserving storage of educational records, while another is how to understand the sharing of educational records and ensure the protection of the process of sharing. In this paper , we propose a scheme for educational records based on blockchain storage and sharing, which incorporates blockchain, storage database and cryptography techniques to create a reliable and protected setting. The blockchain technology is used in our proposal to ensure the protection and reliability of data storage, while the blockchain's smart contracts are used to manage the storage and sharing method. The off-chain database stores the original educational records in encrypted form more specifically, while the records' hash information is stored on the blockchain. To ensure the protection of data storage, the off-chain records are regularly anchored with the hash data on the blockchain. Cryptography approaches are used to manage the encryption of documents and digital signature of messages. The system incorporates a WebApp based interface for the concerned parties involved in the transaction to communicate in an effective manner thereby providing a base for decentralized approach.
